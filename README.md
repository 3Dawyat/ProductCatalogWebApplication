###### Product Catalog Web Application
###### Tech : .Net Core (MVC), MSSQL behind an ORM (EF is preferred)
###### Description: You are asked to develop a system for products. Which contains products that show up for a certain duration. There will be a global list of products, and whenever the application loads, it will return the products that are supposed to show up at the current time. Products have the following properties: a name, a creation date, created by userId, a start date, a duration, and a price.
 ###### Products are also categorized under categories. Categories are created as a seed to the DB and will not be added using the application interface.
######  Managing products (Add/Edit/Delete) should be allowed only for “Admin” users, so you should use Identity to manage the user privileges.
###### You must take in mind topics like security and proper error handling.
###### You must submit your work as a git (GitHub, DevOps, etc.) repo:
###### Application should include:
• View that contains all products regardless of the current time (Admins Only).

• The ability to add a new product (Admins Only).

• The ability to edit an existing product (Admins Only).

• The ability to delete an existing product (Admins Only).
